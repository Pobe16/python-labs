# Rewrite your solution to object_classes/figures.py such that dimensions 
# given in the list of shapes are replaced by a series of dialogue boxes 
# (one for each shape) which accept the appropriate dimension (length of 
# side, diameterâ€¦). For example dialogue box one may ask for the diameter 
# of circle number one. 
# Now extend your solution such that the user dialogue inputs both the 
# type of shape (circle, square etc.) and the relevant dimension.
